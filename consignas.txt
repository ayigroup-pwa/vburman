TASK:

Identify the strategy we currently use in the Service Worker (for caching)
Replace it with a "Network only" strategy => Clear Storage (in Dev Tools), reload & try using your app offline
Replace it with a "Cache only" strategy => Clear Storage (in Dev Tools), reload & try using your app offline
Replace it with "Network, cache fallback" strategy => => Clear Storage (in Dev Tools), reload & try using your app offline
Replace it with a "Cache, then network" strategy => Clear Storage (in Dev Tools), reload & try using your app offline
Add "Routing"/ URL Parsing to pick the right strategies: Try to implement "Cache, then network", "Cache with network fallback" and "Cache only" (all of these, with appropriate URL selection)

Important: Clear your Application Storage first to get rid of the old SW & Cache from the Main Project!
